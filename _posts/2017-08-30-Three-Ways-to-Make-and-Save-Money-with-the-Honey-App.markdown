Once the extension is downloaded, just shop online like you normally would.  The best thing about [Honey][Honey] is that it’s a browser extension so you don't need to use a special platform.  If there’s a promo code field on the site’s checkout page, Honey will crawl the web looking for promo codes and automatically add the best one to your cart.  All you have to do is click the ‘Find Savings!’ button.

[Honey][Honey] is great for shopping on online retail stores like J.Crew, Best Buy, and Lowes.  Honey will also save you money on travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz, and Hotwire with minimal effort.  Ease of use is really where Honey shines, it’s a set it and forget it browser extension which only pops up when you need it. If you click the Honey button outside of a shopping cart, it will display the savings it found for that store; this is somewhat similar to the [SwagButton from Swagbucks][SwagButton from Swagbucks].    


One of the drawbacks of the Honey extension is that its main feature doesn’t really work on Amazon.  Amazon almost never offers site-wide coupon codes so there’s nothing for Honey to add to checkout. The Honey extension turned this weakness into a strength by adding some money-saving features to Amazon’s shopping experience.  The main feature is that Honey will display other sellers on Amazon with the same item for less.  Honey also displays the item’s 30 day price history on Amazon to help you determine the best time to buy.  

<h3>2. HoneyGold</h3>

The Honey extension automatically finds promo codes and applies them to your cart. Honey also gives you cash back on over 3,700 online retailers.  When you shop at sites like Macys, Target, and Walmart, you’ll get anywhere from 0-100% back in Gold. Once you get 1000 Honey Gold, you can cash it in for a $10 Amazon gift card.  You can use your Honey Gold to get gift cards to other stores too like Groupon, Sears, and Brookstone.  

<h3>3. Referral</h3>

Once you [download the Honey browser extension][download the Honey browser extension], be sure invite your friends and family with your invite link.  When they make their first purchase, you’ll get $5.  You can get your invite link by signing into Honey and clicking the ‘Invite’ tab.  

<h3>Honorable Mention</h3>

DropList for the Honey extension will notify you when an item drops in price within the next 90 days.  Right now, it’s only available with Chrome and Amazon.  Droplist is great if you see something on Amazon that catches your eye but don't necessarily need right away.  Add the item to your DropList, and Honey will email you if the item drops more than 5% in price.
