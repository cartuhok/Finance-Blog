[InstaGC][InstaGC] allows you to earn money online for completing tasks like visiting websites, watching videos, completing surveys, and online shopping.   Each task awards you a certain number of points, 100 points is roughly $1.  One thing that sets [InstaGC][InstaGC] apart from their competitors is that their cash out minimum is very low, you only need 100 points to cash out for a $1 Amazon gift card.  This makes InstaGC one of the best side income sites if you need cash immediately.  If you’d rather receive cash instead of gift cards, InstaGC also offers a direct deposit option, as well as paypal, echeck, or even bitcoin.

<h3>1. Clicks - Visit Websites</h3> 

Visiting websites is one of the easiest ways to make money with [InstaGC][InstaGC].  Some are as simple as staying on that website for 10 seconds and interacting with the page.   Others will ask you to complete surveys or watch videos.  Each time you do, you’ll receive points.  Every task in this section will generally repeat every 24 hours which makes it a great way to earn a side income daily with InstaGC.  

<h3>2. Watch Videos</h3>

Watching videos is a great way to earn passive income with [InstaGC][InstaGC].  You’re guaranteed 1 point per every 20 videos you watch, and you can also receive a weekly bonus.  There’s an initial cap at 350 videos per day, but the cap can increase to 650 per day to 2000 per day.  Once your cap is increased to 2000, you could potentially earn $20 daily from watching videos online, not including bonuses.  [InstaGC][InstaGC] offers  3 playlists to choose from.  All 3 playlists can be played at once using the same browser or different devices, as long as the sound is on the browser tab is active / in-view.  There’s a secondary option to watch videos with InstaGC called AdBistro.  AdBistro will award you one point for every 3 videos you watch.

<h3>3. Daily Surveys</h3>

Daily surveys with [InstaGC][InstaGC] awards around 80 points per survey on average.  Daily surveys award the highest payout per task on InstaGC, but they take the most time to complete, and you probably wont be qualified for all of them.  Like all paid survey sites, marketing agencies are looking for a specific demographic and will typically ask some identifying questions at the beginning to see if you fall into their focus group.  Although daily surveys award the highest amount of points, there are other non-daily surveys you can take that award anywhere from 1-200 points.  

<h3>4. Shopping</h3>

Similar to other side income sites like [Swagbucks][Swagbucks], InstaGC rewards you for shopping online.  We still thinks [the Honey extension][the Honey extension] is the best online shopping rewards program, but InstaGC does offer some great discounts.  [InstaGC][InstaGC] offers online shopping rewards in three main ways, cash back, coupons, and points for trial offers.
