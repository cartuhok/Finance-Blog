[BeFrugal][BeFrugal] offers cash back on over 5,000 retailers like Walmart, Macy’s, Adidas, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales, and Footlocker. In addition to cash back, they offer coupon deals to over 50,000 stores, some work even if the item is already on sale.  BeFrugal also offers incentive programs like ‘Bonus Cash Back’, which awards you additional cash back on top of their normal rate.  BeFrugal is great for shopping online, but they also offer a huge amount of printable coupons.  Believe it or not, printed coupons are still very popular.  According to a study done by creditcards.com, 18- to 24-year-olds are actually around twice as likely to hand over a printed coupon than enter a discount code at checkout.  In addition to retailers, BeFrugal also offers discounts to hundreds of restaurants and travel sites.
