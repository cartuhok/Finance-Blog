While Earnably definitely wont replace a full time job, it’s a great way to make a side income during your free time.  We’ve outlined the 5 best ways to make money online using Earnably below.  

<h3>1. Take Surveys</h3>

A great way to make money online using [Earnably][Earnably] is to take surveys.  Earnably has a pretty generous payout compared to other online survey sites.  The average survey on Earnably awards you around 75 points (~$0.75) and are about 5-15 minutes long.  There’s also 30 minute long surveys that award you 125 points.  We like that Earnably uses a flat-rate survey  system, not having to search for higher paying surveys will definitely save you a lot of time in the long run.  Like all survey sites, maximizing your time is key.  When taking surveys, be sure to answer all questions honestly, not doing so may result in not getting paid.  It’s also important to note that you may not qualify for all surveys.  

<h3>2. Watch Videos</h3> 

One of the easiest ways to make money online with [Earnably][Earnably] is to watch videos.  Earnably partners with 3 main sites, EngageMe, Video Loyalty, and VideoLab to award you points for watching ads.  While the payout on watching videos is pretty low, as long as the video tab is active and viewable on the screen, you’ll get paid.  VideoLab will pay you 0.7 points for every 14 videos you watch, and it autoplays meaning you can just keep it up 24/7 as long as the video remains viewable.  This is a pretty passive way to earn a side income online that requires almost zero effort.

<h3>3. Complete Tasks</h3> 

Similar to [Amazon mTurk][Amazon mTurk], companies will partner with [Earnably][Earnably] and pay you for completing tasks using a service called CrowdFlower.  Tasks can range from transcribing audio, finding how many employees work for a company, or validating road signs.  The points awarded for each task varies, but it averages around 5 points per task.  If you’re good at using Google, this may be a great way to earn money online using [Earnably][Earnably] in your free time.  Some of these tasks require you to be level 1, 2, or 3 so the more tasks you complete the more jobs become available for you.  

<h3>4. Play Games</h3> 

Earnably partnered up with GSN casino allowing you to play games and earn rewards.  Signing up with GSN through Earnably will give you 12,500 tokens which you can turn in for Amazon or Visa gift cards when you accumulate enough.  While it may be good entertainment, most of the games on the site are basically slots or video poker, aka gambling.  Because of this, we don’t recommend this portion of Earnably.  There’s plenty of other ways to make money online that don’t require you leaving it up to chance. 

<h3>5. Apps</h3>

Earnably has a huge amount of apps they will pay you to download and use.  What was surprising is that some of the apps we already had on our phones.   Some of them are games like Final Fantasy XV, which currently is awarding 880 points for reaching level 10. Others are useful apps like Stash, which is an investment app that will help you save money.
