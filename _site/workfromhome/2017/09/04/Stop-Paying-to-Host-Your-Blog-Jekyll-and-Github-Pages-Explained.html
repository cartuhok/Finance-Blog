    <p>When starting a blog, there’s two main operating expenses to consider, buying a custom domain, and hosting your site.  You can host your site for free on platforms like Wordpress or Blogger, but you can’t use a custom domain unless you pay for hosting.  Hosting a site can be expensive, it can run about $5 per month on average.  Especially for new blogs, that’s a huge operating expense and will make it difficult to turn a profit within the 1st year.   Thankfully, with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, you can host your site for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a simple, blog aware static site generator.  It’s completely free and you can get a site up and running within an hour.  To install Jekyll, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">visit their instructions page</a>.  Like Wordpress, Jekyll has <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">hundreds of themes you can choose from</a>, virtually all of which are free under the MIT License.  With Jekyll, you can choose a beautiful, fully responsive theme for your website without paying a dime for ‘premium’ themes like those offered on Wordpress or Blogger.  Rather design the site yourself?  One of the best things about Jekyll is that it’s fully customizable.  If you know some HTML and CSS you can build your blog from scratch to get the look that you’re going for.</p>

<p>Now that your blog is up and running, you can start writings posts.  You can blog in HTML or Markdown, or other formats with the proper converter installed. There’s a suite of free Jekyll SEO plugins available on Github to make sure that your blog is optimized for search engines.  This means that you wont lose any SEO capabilities from blogging with Jekyll, or migrating your existing blog.  To start a post, just name your file with the date and title like this “2017-09-04-my-awesome-blog-post.md” and it will automatically appear on your site.</p>

<p>Ready to publish your blog?  The first step is to purchase a custom domain.  We recommend <a href="https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=121268">namecheap.com</a>,  they make registering and managing domains simple and affordable.  Domains on <a href="https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=121268">namecheap</a> start as low as $0.88 per year.  Now here’s where the savings start: with Jekyll, you can host your site for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, even with a custom domain.  Start a repository by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">following the instructions on their webpage</a>, and you’ll have your site up and running within minutes.  You can host one site per repository, so if you have multiple blogs you can save hundreds of dollars per year on hosting.  To make publishing posts even easier, we recommend using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.  Github servers are extremely reliable with a 99.95% uptime and used by thousands of blogs, companies, and organizations worldwide.</p>

We want to present this information to you so you can make an educated decision before unnecessarily paying to host your site with a custom domain.
