    <h3>What is Swagbucks? </h3>
<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Swagbucks</a> allows you to earn points for things you already do online like searching the web, playing video games, shopping, and watching videos.  The points are called SB and each point is equivalent to about $0.01.  You can redeem those points in exchange for gift cards to popular stores like Amazon, or even direct deposit it into your PayPal account.</p>

<h3>How Much Can I Earn?</h3>
<p>To date, Swagbucks has awarded almost $200mil to its members.  While Swagbucks probably won’t replace a full time job, it’s not uncommon for members to make $350+ monthly using the methods outlined below.  Before we <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">get started</a>, it’s important to note that earning a substantial income on Swagbucks takes some dedication.  Swagbucks is not a scam, it’s a legitimate service but it will only reward you for the effort you put in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/?cmd=sb-register&amp;rb=38840416&amp;cmp=72&amp;cxid=1440-htmlembed" target="_blank"><img src="//app2-cdn2.sbx-cdn.com/content/pages/promote-and-earn/swagbucks-share-1440-v2.png" height="252" width="663" border="0" alt="Join Swagbucks!" /></a></p>

<h3>Get Started </h3>
<p>The first thing you’d want to do to start earning is <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">sign up</a>.  Signing up will award you 4 SB and completing your profile will earn you an additional 32 SB.  The next step is to install their browser extension called the SwagButton.  Just installing it will earn you 50 SB ($0.50) and it’s definitely a useful tool.  One of our favorite features is that the SwagButton automatically notifies you if the website you are visiting offers cash back for shopping there.  It also has some great features like alerting you about new earning opportunities like taking surveys which we’ll get into later.</p>

<h3>How to Earn</h3>
<p>Next, <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">check out the to-do list</a>.  The to-do list is a great way to get accommodated with all the features Swagbucks has to offer.  Each item on the to-do list will award you SB, completing 6 of the 8 items will award you a 1-4 SB bonus pay out.  Even better, completing the daily tasks consecutively gives you win streaks.  For example, completing the daily tasks 7 days in a row awards you an additional 25 SB on top of the points you earned completing the individual tasks and their bonuses.  14 days and you’ll get 100 SB, 21 you’ll get 200 SB, and 31 you’ll get 300 SB! You want to get into the habit of completing these daily goals as it’s essentially free money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/?cmd=sb-register&amp;rb=38840416&amp;cmp=72&amp;cxid=1480-htmlembed" target="_blank"><img src="//app2-cdn2.sbx-cdn.com/content/pages/promote-and-earn/swagbucks-share-1480-v2.png" height="252" width="663" border="0" alt="Join Swagbucks!" /></a></p>

<p>After completing the daily goals, you’re free to start looking around for more ways to earn.  Thankfully with Swagbucks, <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">there’s tons of options</a>.</p>

<h3>Play Games</h3>
<p>Just playing one of their online games will award you 10 SB daily, or ~300 SB monthly, win or lose. Our favorite is <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Swagasaurus Run</a>.</p>

<h3>Take Surveys</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Surveys</a> are a great way to earn money, and the good news is there’s always new ones for you to answer.  Some take longer to complete than others, but the longer surveys generally reward you more points.  The average survey will give you around 50-100 SB.</p>

<h3>Shop</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Shopping with Swagbucks</a> is a no-brainer.  We all shop online, why not earn cash back on top of it?  Chances are, Swagbucks offers cash back for stores you already shop at like Amazon and Walmart.  You can earn up to 3% cash back shopping online on either of these stores.  Plus there’s literally hundreds of stores to choose from like eBay, Best Buy, JCPenny, Target, and Old Navy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/?cmd=sb-register&amp;rb=38840416&amp;cmp=72&amp;cxid=1420-htmlembed" target="_blank"><img src="//app2-cdn2.sbx-cdn.com/content/pages/promote-and-earn/swagbucks-share-1420-v2.png" height="252" width="663" border="0" alt="Join Swagbucks!" /></a></p>

<h3>Watch Videos</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Rather sit back and relax</a>?  Swagbucks has you covered.  In fact, watching videos on Swagbucks is one of the best ways to make a side income.  You can either watch them online from your desktop computer, or download one (or all) of Swagbucks six mobile apps for video.  The six apps are Swagbucks tv, Entertainow, Moviecli.ps, Sportly.tv, Indymusic.tv, and Lifestylz.tv.  All of the apps are available on either iOS or Android and can be found on the app store.  Each app will allow you to earn 10SB daily (60 SB total)! This would amount to 1800 SB ($18.00) monthly from just watching videos alone!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Chances are, whether it’s playing games online, shopping, or simply watching videos, you’re probably doing most of these things already, why not get paid for it? This article is just the tip of the iceberg.  There’s so many other ways to earn on <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Swagbucks</a>, like their Swagbucks Local, which gives you up to 10% cash back on local restaurants near you. <a href="http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=38840416">Sign up</a> now and see how you can start earning (and saving) today!</p>
