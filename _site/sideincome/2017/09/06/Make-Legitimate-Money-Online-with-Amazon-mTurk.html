    <p><a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>, or mTurk, is a crowdsourcing website that enables individuals or businesses (known as Requesters) to post tasks (called HIT - Human Intelligence Tasks) for workers (Turkers) to complete for money.  Amazon Mechanical Turk was started by Amazon in 2005 and is one of the most trusted ways to make money online.  When the task is completed and approved, Amazon issues payment through the Requesters account. Payments for each task on mTurk can range around $.01-$30.00. Although mTurk is one of the most trusted ways to make money online, there’s a learning curve and it takes some time management skills.</p>

<h3>What Type of Work is on mTurk? </h3>

<p><a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/findhits?match=false&amp;state=YVRVZWRnQzhYSGlqcWY1SkYwU2dNSHlkUEEwPTIwMTcwOTA2MTcyMVVzZXIudHVya1NlY3VyZX50cnVlJQ--">There are various types of Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) available on mTurk</a>.  They include data a entry, image classification, subtitle transcription, translation, writing, editing, tagging, and much more.  For example, one Requester on mTurk might ask you to find the purchase lines on a receipt, type descriptions for photos, rate the quality of a translation, find an address for rental descriptions, or take a survey.  There are literally thousands of HITs available to choose from to make money online.</p>

<h3>Am I Qualified to Work on Amazon Mechanical Turk or mTurk? </h3>

<p>In order to start working on mTurk, you have to be approved by Amazon.  The service is available to US residents over the age of 18.  You can sign up as a Worker if you are a non-U.S. resident, but your chances of being approved are lower according to some message boards.</p>

<p>If you are approved to work on mTurk, there are some HITs that require additional qualifications.  Some Requesters require you to have some sort of education like a high school or college degree, others require you to be bilingual.  If you are bilingual, mTurk is an especially great way to make money online.  Some Requesters require a certain number of HITs to be successfully completed on your profile before they’ll accept you for their task.</p>

<h3>How Much Money Can I Make on mTurk?</h3>

<p>The amount of money you can make on mTurk really depends on your qualifications and how much time you put into it.  To start, you are capped at 100 HITs/day.  The HIT limit is increased to 3,800 HITs/day after about 10 days. The payouts on HITs can range anywhere from ~$0.01-$30.00. The higher paying hits generally are for transcribing audio and require a qualification test.  The lower paying HITs require a lot less time and some tasks can be completed in seconds.  In order to make money online with mTurk, you should focus on maximizing your time with lower paying HITs, and try to set a goal of $0.10 per minute.  This would net you around $240 per month if you put in 10 hours weekly, which is a very achievable goal in your 1st month.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/1tjge3/over_1100_and_5000_approvals_in_my_first_month_of/?st=j79o5j1y&amp;sh=bf109c69">One person on Reddit made over $1,100 in their 1st month</a>.  While making $1k+ per month online with mTurk may be out of the ordinary, it’s definitely achievable depending on how much time you put in and how efficiently you use that time.  There’s also a subreddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/">HITs worth Turking for</a> where users can post links to well paying tasks, we recommend checking them out if you’re interested in making money online with mTurk.</p>
