  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=7233540">PrizeRebel</a> was founded in 2007 and has helped more than 6 million members make a side income online.  With PrizeRebel, you can earn points for completing tasks online like taking surveys and watching videos. 100 points with PrizeRebel is equivalent to $1, and you can redeem your points for gift cards, PayPal Cash, or direct deposit.  Here’s three easy ways to make a side income online with PrizeRebel:</p>

<h3>1. Surveys</h3>

<p>Like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/08/29/Swagbucks-Review-2017-How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make.html">Swagbucks</a>, <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/20/3-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-with-EarnHoney.html">EarnHoney</a>, and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/03/Five-Easy-Ways-to-Make-a-Side-Income-with-InstaGC.html">InstaGC</a>, PrizeRebel has numerous surveys that will pay you to take them.  To get started, fill in some basic information about yourself like name, age, and income; PrizeRebel will find surveys you’re qualified to take.  The surveys take around 3-30 minutes to complete and will award you around 60-300 points ($0.60-$3.00 USD).  Like most sites that pay you to take surveys, you want to try and utilize your time efficiently.  For example, there might be two surveys that both award 70 points, but one only takes 3 minutes and the other takes 30.  Go with the 3 minute survey, a good rule of thumb is to try and complete the ones that take the least amount of time first.  You can complete 10 surveys that award 70 points before you’d finish with the 30 minute survey.  Don’t get discouraged if you’re not qualified for every survey, this is normal and <a href="https://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=7233540">PrizeRebel</a> is constantly updating their list.</p>

<h3>2.  Watch Videos</h3>

<p>Like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/08/29/Swagbucks-Review-2017-How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make.html">Swagbucks</a>, <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/20/3-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-with-EarnHoney.html">EarnHoney</a>, and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/03/Five-Easy-Ways-to-Make-a-Side-Income-with-InstaGC.html">InstaGC</a>, PrizeRebel also allows you to earn income online passively by watching videos.  With most make money online sites, PrizeRebel included, they just require the sound to be on and the video to be visible in an active tab.  PrizeRebel’s payout for watching videos is .55 points for every three ads that play between videos.  They use some of the same streaming services that other sites use like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/08/29/Swagbucks-Review-2017-How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make.html">Swagbucks</a>, namely EngageMe and Encrave.  While the payout for videos isn’t high, PrizeRebel allows you to watch 120 every 24 hours. If you just keep them playing, that could net you $20+ per month from watching videos alone.</p>

<h3>3.  Complete Tasks</h3>

<p>Similar to <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/06/Make-Legitimate-Money-Online-with-Amazon-mTurk.html">Amazon’s mTurk</a> and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/14/5-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-With-Earnably.html">Earnably</a>, PrizeRebel will pay you for completing small tasks online.  PrizeRebel’s tasks are very similar to what’s offered on <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/06/Make-Legitimate-Money-Online-with-Amazon-mTurk.html">mTurk</a>, you can transcribe audio, or find phone numbers for businesses.  The monetary payout varies on the type of task, but the average is around 6 points.  Like getting paid to take surveys, it’s all about managing your time wisely.  You don’t want to get caught up transcribing audio, but if you’re good at using Google you can earn a great side income with the task section of <a href="https://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=7233540">PrizeRebel</a>.  For example, finding a companies’ phone number may only take 30 seconds.  If you get 6 points for doing it, you’d be able to make around $5 an hour.</p>
