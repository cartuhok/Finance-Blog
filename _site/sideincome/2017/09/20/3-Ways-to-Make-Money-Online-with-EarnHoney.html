  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="www.earnhoney.com/home/?referrer=11E7947C73">EarnHoney.com</a> is an online rewards site similar to <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/08/29/Swagbucks-Review-2017-How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make.html">Swagbucks</a>, <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/03/Five-Easy-Ways-to-Make-a-Side-Income-with-InstaGC.html">InstaGC</a>, and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/14/5-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-With-Earnably.html">Earnably</a>.  They are the #2 ranked site to earn money online during your free time.   With EarnHoney, you can get paid for completing tasks like watching videos, taking surveys, and playing games.  EarnHoney has a Better Business Bureau rating of A+ and was founded in 2014.</p>

<p>To start earning a side income with EarnHoney.com, visit their <a href="www.earnhoney.com/home/?referrer=11E7947C73">sign in page</a>. Creating an account is free and you can start earning right away.  When you complete tasks like watching videos or answering surveys, you get “Honey Dollar$”.

<h3>1. Watching Videos</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to earn a side income online with EarnHoney is watching videos.  Videos have to be displayed in an active tab with the volume on, but it’s an easy way to passively earn up to $30 per month.  There are different payouts on videos, some allow you to earn up to 120 Honey Dollar$ per day by just keeping the videos running.  Others will pay 0.25 Honey Dollar$ per video.  The video selection is pretty decent, they range from how-to videos to news and entertainment.</p>

<h3>2. Take Surveys</h3>

<p>Similar to <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/03/Five-Easy-Ways-to-Make-a-Side-Income-with-InstaGC.html">InstaGC</a> and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/08/29/Swagbucks-Review-2017-How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make.html">Swagbucks</a>, taking surveys on <a href="www.earnhoney.com/home/?referrer=11E7947C73">EarnHoney</a> is a great way to make money online.   In order to access surveys, complete your profile by filling in your name, age, location, and other demographic information.   EarnHoney will find surveys applicable to you which you can complete for Honey Dollar$.  Like most survey sites, the longer ones are usually the highest paying. Surveys on EarnHoney award around 50-300HD on average and will last anywhere from 5-20 minutes.  You can also earn badges by letting EarnHoney know a little more about yourself which will unlock higher paying surveys.</p>

<h3>3. Games</h3>

<p>We’re really a fan of the game section of <a href="www.earnhoney.com/home/?referrer=11E7947C73">EarnHoney</a>.  They may not have a huge selection of games like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/14/5-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-With-Earnably.html">Earnably</a>, in fact it’s only 1 game, but we think that’s better for a few reasons.  First, the game is 2048, which is a genuinely fun, addicting game.  To play, you slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.  It’s an incredibly simple game but we could play it for hours; which is great because you can earn up to 3 Honey Dollar$ for each 10 minutes you play.  Second, EarnHoney doesn’t redirect you to a third party site like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/14/5-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-With-Earnably.html">Earnably</a> does to play games.  Lastly, EarnHoney does something we haven’t seen on any other side income site, it splits half of the screen to the game and half to a video, which means you can earn from both at the same time.  We really like this, and have to commend EarnHoney for giving their users this functionality.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With their Better Business Rating of A+, and giving their users a way to make a great side income online, we definitely recommend EarnHoney.
