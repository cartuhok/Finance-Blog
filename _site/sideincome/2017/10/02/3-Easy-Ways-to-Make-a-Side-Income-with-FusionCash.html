    <p><a href="http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=gimmiemonies">FusionCash</a> was founded in 2005 and have a Better Business Bureau Rating of A+.  Similar to sites like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/08/29/Swagbucks-Review-2017-How-Much-Money-Can-You-Make.html">SwagBucks</a>, <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/03/Five-Easy-Ways-to-Make-a-Side-Income-with-InstaGC.html">InstaGC</a>, <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/14/5-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-With-Earnably.html">Earnably</a>, and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/27/3-Ways-To-Make-A-Side-Income-Online-With-PrizeRebel.html">PrizeRebel</a>, FusionCash will pay you for completing tasks online like taking surveys, watching videos, and playing games.  One thing we like about FusionCash is they don’t have a points system.  All of their payouts are listed in US Dollars, so you don’t have have to spend time converting points when it’s time to get paid. Here’s 3 easy ways to make money online using FusionCash:</p>

<h3>1. Watching Videos</h3>

<p>Watching videos is a great way to make a passive side income with <a href="http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=gimmiemonies">FusionCash</a>.  FusionCash primarily uses a site called VideoLab. VideoLab will autoplay videos, which means you can passively earn 24/7 by keeping the videos running.  Like all sites that will pay you for watching videos, the tab has to be active with the sound on.  As long as the tab is viewable, the videos will keep playing and with FusionCash, and you’ll get paid 1 cent for every 14 minutes of videos watched.  If you kept the videos running 24/7, you could earn up to $30 a month from watching videos alone.</p>

<h3>2. Take Surveys</h3>

<p>FusionCash offers daily surveys you can complete. The payouts are on par with other paid survey sites like <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/20/3-Ways-to-Make-Money-Online-with-EarnHoney.html">EarnHoney</a> and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/03/Five-Easy-Ways-to-Make-a-Side-Income-with-InstaGC.html">InstaGC</a>.  Most surveys on <a href="http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=gimmiemonies">FusionCash</a> are under 20 minutes and the payouts are around $0.50-$2.00.  Like all survey sites, you want to find the ones that have the highest payouts that take the least amount of time to complete.  Don’t get discouraged if you don’t qualify for all the surveys. FusionCash is constantly updating their available surveys so be sure to check back daily for more to complete.</p>

<h3>3. Complete Tasks</h3>

<p>Like Amazon’s <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/06/Make-Legitimate-Money-Online-with-Amazon-mTurk.html">mTurk</a> and <a href="http://gimmiemonies.com/sideincome/2017/09/27/3-Ways-To-Make-A-Side-Income-Online-With-PrizeRebel.html">PrizeRebel</a>, FusionCash will pay you to complete tasks online.  Tasks can vary from transcribing audio, categorizing popular product names, or finding a business phone number.  If you’re good at using Google, this can be a great way to start earning money online with FusionCash.  <a href="http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=gimmiemonies">FusionCash</a> uses the same service PrizeRebel does, Crowflower. Crowdflower uses a leveling system, which means the more tasks you successfully complete, the more tasks become available to you.  Most of the higher paying tasks require you to be at least level 2, so when you’re first starting out, expect to get only get paid $0.01-$0.02 per task.  However, once you reach level 2 or 3 you can make a great side income online with this method.</p>

<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>

<p>There’s some other great ways to make a side income online using <a href="http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=gimmiemonies">FusionCash</a> like their ‘Paid to Click’ section.  FusionCash will provide you a list of websites to visit, if you visit 4 of them and stay on each site for at least 2 1/2 minutes, you’ll get paid $0.15.  Posting in their forums can earn you $3 per month, they’ll even pay you $0.25 for following them on Twitter.  Like most make money online sites, they’re not going to make you rich.  However, if you put 2-3 hours a week into it, you can make a great side income online.  Interested in giving FusionCash a try? <a href="http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=gimmiemonies">Sign up here</a>.
