    <p><a href="acorns.com/invite/VX2C78">Acorns</a> is an investment app available on Android and iOS that invests your spare change automatically into a portfolio of ETFs.  Using a system called ‘Round-Ups’, Acorns links a debit or credit card and invests your spare change from daily purchases.  For example, if you purchase a coffee for $1.25, Acorns will round up to $2.00 and invest $.75 into your account.  Ease of use and simplicity is Acorns’ main selling point.  It may not be the most robust investment tool, but it’s a great way to get introduced to investing if you’re 1st starting out.</p>

<h3>Other Features</h3>

<p>While investing your spare change is <a href="acorns.com/invite/VX2C78">Acorns</a> main focus, there are some other great money saving features too.  One of the newer features is ‘Found Money’, which is thier version of a cash-back rewards program.  When you shop with online retailers like Macy’s, you get a percentage or fixed dollar amount invested back into your account.  For example, if you buy a jacket for $120 at Macys, Acorns will invest 5%, or $6, into your account.  Another money saving feature with Acorns is their Round-Up multiplier.   Instead of only investing your spare change, you can multiply your spare change to 2x, 3x, or 10x.  For example, for that same $1.25 cup of coffee with a 3x multiplier, Acorns will round up to $3.50 and invest $2.25, or $0.75x3.  You can also make automatic, monthly deposits from your bank account.</p>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>

<p>When <a href="acorns.com/invite/VX2C78">Acorns</a> invests your money, it deposits it into ETFs.  There are 5 portfolios to choose from: Conservative, Moderately Conservative, Moderate, Moderately Aggressive, and Aggressive.  Depending on what portfolio you choose, Acorns will invest a certain percentage into various stocks and bonds.  There are 7 main groups:  Government and corporate bonds, small and large company stocks, emerging market stocks, real estate stocks, and large international company stocks.  For example, if you choose a Conservative portfolio, Acorns will invest the majority of your money (35%) into government bonds.  If you choose the Aggressive portfolio, Acorns will invest the majority of your money (35%) into small company stocks.  You’re also able to switch your portfolio using the app.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>If your balance is below $5,000, <a href="acorns.com/invite/VX2C78">Acorns</a> charges a flat fee $1 per month.  For balances over $5,000, Acorns charges an annual fee of 0.25% of your account balance.  While the fee is on the lower end when compared to other financial services, it can be quite high depending on how much you’re investing.  For example, if you make 50 transactions and have an average of $0.35 rounded up per transaction, that a 5.7% fee.  This fee will go down depending on how many transactions you make monthly.  Although the fee is high, it may not make a noticeable difference until you have a significant savings.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you’re new to investing, we think <a href="acorns.com/invite/VX2C78">Acorns</a> is a great way to get started.  Acorns only requires a $5 investment to open an account, and their app is extremely easy to use.  After you link your debit or credit card, Acorns really takes care of everything else.  It’s not the most robust investment service, but Acorns really shines with its hands-off approach and low barrier to entry. Everything from setup to implementation is a breeze and it may help if you’re struggling to save money with more traditional investment services.</p>
