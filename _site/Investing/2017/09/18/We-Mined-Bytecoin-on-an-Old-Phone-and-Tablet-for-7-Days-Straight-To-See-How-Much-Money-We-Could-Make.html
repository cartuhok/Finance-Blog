    <p>Turns out, not a lot.  But 1st, a little more about Bytecoin and how we did it.  <a href="https://bytecoin.org/">Bytecoin</a> is a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin that originally launched in 2012.  According to their website, it’s the 1st enterprise-ready cryptocurrency solution that is fast and secure.  One of the main selling points of Bytecoin is that it allows for international money transfers quickly. Transferring money internationally quickly and securely is incredibly useful for businesses and consumers alike.  Usually, if you transfer money using a traditional bank, it would take 2-3 business days to appear in the payees account.  With Bytecoin, instead of waiting days transfer money internationally, it takes about 120 seconds.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of hype around cryptocurrency lately, and in our opinion a lot of overhype.  Cryptocurrency is a volatile market.  At the time of this article, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called cryptocurrency a ‘fraud’ which sent the markets tumbling.  Our opinion of cryptocurrency is somewhere in-between. We think parts of cryptocurrecy are overhyped, but  we can see the real world uses in crypto, and transferring money internationally is at the top of that list.</p>

<p>We chose Bytecoin because it’s relatively easy to mine.  It takes less a lot hardware to mine Bytecoin than it does for bigger currencies like Bitcoin, and even makes it possible to mine on your phone. Here’s how we did it:</p>

<h3>The Devices Used</h3>

<p>We had two old devices lying around collecting dust, so we put them to work.  One was a 2013 Nexus 5 phone running Android 6.0.1, the other a 2012 Nexus 7 tablet running Android 5.1.1.  While both of these devices are incredibly outdated in 2017, they were Google’s flagship phone and tablet when introduced.</p>

<h3>The Software Used</h3>

<p>To mine Bytecoin, we used an app called <a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef">Minergate</a>, which is available on the Google Play store.  We chose Minergate because it seemed to be the most popular mining app, and also because it was extremely easy to set up.  All you have to do is create a Minergate account, choose which currency you want to mine, and press a button.  The app runs in the background so your screen doesn’t have to be on.  However, the app is a huge drain on battery so if you’re interested in giving it a shot, we recommend having the phone/tablet plugged in.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Once we downloaded the app, we left the phone and tablet plugged in and running for 7 days straight to see how much Bytecoin we could mine.  We monitored our progress using Minergate’s dashboard, which you can access from your browser.  We specifically kept an eye on our hash rate, which is essentially how fast you’re mining.  The higher the hash rate, the more opportunity there is of obtaining coins.  What we found is that the Nexus 5 averaged around 15 H/s, and the Nexus 7 around 5 H/s.</p>

<p>What was interesting was this wasn’t really reflected in their dashboard, most of the time it said we were mining at 0 H/s and that our devices were offline.  We learned that jumping on and offline is normal, but the dashboard GUI seems a little buggy providing realtime information.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p>At the end of day 1, we mined around 4.19 Bytecoins.  This meant the we should expect to see around 28 Bytecoins at the end of the week.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef">Minergate</a> app kept the same pace for day 2.  At the end of the day, we mined about 8.13 Bytecoins total.  It was a modest pace, but we were happy with the results.  However, by the start of day 3, we knew we were in for a long week.</p>

<p><a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef" target="_blank"><img src="/MinergateDay2.jpg" width="663" border="0" alt="Minergate App" /></a></p>

<h3>Day 3</h3>

<p>One of the major hurdles we kept running into is that the app would force quit, so we had to constantly check to see if the app was running and restart the app if necessary.  All in all, we estimate we lost around 10 hours of mining due to the app force quitting.  Because of this, we kept the app running an additional 10 hours after the 7 days to make up for the difference.</p>

<p>The force quitting could have happened for a number of reasons.  The devices themselves could have cause the app to stop because it was using too many resources.  It could have quit because there were too many devices using wi-fi so it got booted off the network.  We’re not saying this is Minergate’s fault, in fact it most likely is the devices. However, it’s important to know this is probably something you’ll run into if you’d like to try this at home.</p>

<p>At the end of day 3, we were up to 11.09 Bytecoins total, which was well behind our original 4 Bytecoin/day pace.</p>

<h3>Day 4</h3>

<p>The pace got even slower on day 4.  At days end, we were up to 13.56 Bytecoins, which meant we only mined 2.47 Bytecoins that day, almost half what we got on previous days.</p>

<p><a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef" target="_blank"><img src="/MinergateDay4.jpg" width="663" border="0" alt="Minergate App" /></a></p>

<h3>Day 5</h3>

<p>Day 5 we were up to 16.54 Bytecoins.   Definitely an increase from day 3, but still only a 2.98 coin yield for the day.   Questions started looming if this was even worth it, but we had to push on, only 2 days left.</p>

<p><a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef" target="_blank"><img src="/MinergateDay5.jpg" width="663" border="0" alt="Minergate App" /></a></p>

<h3>Day 6</h3>

<p>Another modest increase on day 6.  We ended the day with 19.06 Bytecoin, a 3.06 coin increase from day 5.  We knew at this point that we were not going to reach the projected 28 coins total, but hoped we could get somewhere in the ballpark.</p>

<p><a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef" target="_blank"><img src="/MinergateDay6.jpg" width="663" border="0" alt="Minergate App" /></a></p>

<h3>Day 7</h3>

<p>Not much of an increase in day 7.  We finished our 7 day experiment with a total of 21.6 coins.  As mentioned above, we kept the app running for an additional 10 hours to make up for downtime.  When all was said and done, we mined 24.17 Bytecoins total, about 4 Bytecoins less than what we originally projected.</p>

<p><a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef" target="_blank"><img src="/MinergateDay7.jpg" width="663" border="0" alt="Minergate App" /></a></p>

<h3>Was It Worth It?</h3>

<p>Short answer, no.  At the time of this article, a Bytecoin is worth about $0.001 cent (USD).  The Bytecoins we mined would amount to a whopping $0.03 cents.  Fair to say, we spent more than that in electricity keeping the devices charged while they mined.  On top of that, we can’t even withdraw our $0.03 cents.  With <a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef">Minergate</a>, you have to mine at least 100 Bytecoin to withdraw.  We’ll probably continue to mine until we reach 100, but if you’re paying for electricity we can’t recommend you try this.</p>

<p>There is a possibility that Bytecoin’s price increases in the coming years. Back in 2010, Bitcoin was worth about $0.06 and is now hovering around $4k.  However, the chances that happens to Bytecoin are pretty slim, even the most bullish projections have Bytecoin going to $1 in the coming years, and it’s pure speculation.</p>

<p>Gimmiemonies.com prides itself in giving you the best and most trusted ways to make and save money online.  This article was simply a experiment, we can’t say that this is the best or most trusted way to make money online.  If you’re interested in trying this, we hope this article outlines what you can expect.  If you have some old devices lying around and don’t pay for electricity, you can find the Minergate app <a href="https://minergate.com/a/7329764ffb8d1459d50bd1ef">here</a>.</p>
