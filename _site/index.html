            <div id="excerpt"><p>When starting a blog, there’s two main operating expenses to consider, buying a custom domain, and hosting your site.  You can host your site for free on platforms like Wordpress or Blogger, but you can’t use a custom domain unless you pay for hosting.  Hosting a site can be expensive, it can run about $5 per month on average.  Especially for new blogs, that’s a huge operating expense and will make it difficult to turn a profit within the 1st year.   Thankfully, with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, you can host your site for free.</p>
