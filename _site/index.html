            <div id="excerpt"><p><a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>, or mTurk, is a crowdsourcing website that enables individuals or businesses (known as Requesters) to post tasks (called HIT - Human Intelligence Tasks) for workers (Turkers) to complete for money.  Amazon Mechanical Turk was started by Amazon in 2005 and is one of the most trusted ways to make money online.  When the task is completed and approved, Amazon issues payment through the Requesters account. Payments for each task on mTurk can range around $.01-$30.00. Although mTurk is one of the most trusted ways to make money online, there’s a learning curve and it takes some time management skills.</p>

            <div id="excerpt"><p>When starting a blog, there’s two main operating expenses to consider, buying a custom domain, and hosting your site.  You can host your site for free on platforms like Wordpress or Blogger, but you can’t use a custom domain unless you pay for hosting.  Hosting a site can be expensive, it can run about $5 per month on average.  Especially for new blogs, that’s a huge operating expense and will make it difficult to turn a profit within the 1st year.   Thankfully, with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, you can host your site for free.</p>

            <div id="excerpt"><p><a href="https://www.instagc.com/gimmiemonies">InstaGC</a> allows you to earn money online for completing tasks like visiting websites, watching videos, completing surveys, and online shopping.   Each task awards you a certain number of points, 100 points is roughly $1.  One thing that sets <a href="https://www.instagc.com/gimmiemonies">InstaGC</a> apart from their competitors is that their cash out minimum is very low, you only need 100 points to cash out for a $1 Amazon gift card.  This makes InstaGC one of the best side income sites if you need cash immediately.  If you’d rather receive cash instead of gift cards, InstaGC also offers a direct deposit option, as well as paypal, echeck, or even bitcoin.</p>
