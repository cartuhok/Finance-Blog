  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>At its core, <a href="http://www.asktrim.com/">Trim</a> is a virtual assistant that will identify and manage your recurring payments and even help you cancel the ones you don’t need. Trim started in 2015 and has saved its users over over $8,000,000.  Trim can also help save you money by identifying if something you purchased on Amazon had a price drop, and offering cash back rewards.</p>

<h3>1. Manage Your Reoccurring Charges</h3>

<p>Ever sign up for a free 30 day trial only to remember a year later that you never canceled?  With <a href="http://www.asktrim.com/">Trim</a>, it’s easy to manage your reoccurring subscriptions and even cancel them without having to contact the company.  When you link your Visa card with Trim, it will automatically identify your reoccurring subscriptions like Comcast, Netflix, Spotify, and SnackCrate. You can text Trim or Facebook message “Subscriptions” to get a list of the ongoing subscriptions on your account.</p>

<p>From there, you can reply “Cancel Netflix” or “Cancel Comcast” and Trim will automatically cancel them for you.  We like this for two reasons.  First, we’re always forgetting our passwords to our subscriptions.  With Trim, you don’t have to spend time logging into your subscription accounts, finding that elusive cancel button, and going through all the ‘are you sure?’ prompts.  Second, we don’t have to call anyone.  It’s even worse calling places like Comcast and waiting on hold forever to try an cancel.  Just text Trim “Cancel Comcast” and it will take care of the rest.  Trim will send you a confirmation when the account is canceled.  Having one place you can go to manage and cancel your ongoing subscriptions is a huge time saver.</p>

<h3>2. Cash Back Rewards</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.asktrim.com/">Trim</a> also offers cash back rewards when you link your Visa card.  They use a hands off approach by letting you know what the deal is, and automatically applying the cash back when you shop.  For example, if you spend $5 at any U.S. grocery store, Trim will automatically give you $1 cash back.  Another deal they have right now is if you spend $20 at any U.S. movie theater, you’ll get $10 cash back.  We really like this because you don’t actively have to search for coupons or deals, Trim will just automatically add them from your everyday shopping if they find an eligible purchase.</p>

<h3>3.  Negotiate Your Bill Automatically</h3>

<p>If you’ve ever signed up with Comcast or cell phone provider you’ll know they usually lure you in with a low rate for 6-12 months and then increase your bill significantly after the promotional deal is over.  You could give them a call, spend time on hold, and hope to get a better rate once you reach someone.  However, with Trim, they can do all that for you, it’s like having your own personal assistant.  Trims chatbot will contact a customer service agent, and negotiate a lower monthly statement.  Trim will not try to change your plan, meaning you’ll get the same services for a lower amount.  They will even monitor your Comcast service and request a credit if there’s any outages.  We think this is the best part about Trim, and it’s a super easy way to save time any money.</p>
